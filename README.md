# Banking-System
This Python script implements a basic banking system using the requests and random libraries. It allows users to register, create accounts, add balance, and remove balance through a series of GET requests to local endpoints. The script includes functions to generate account numbers, handle user registration, fetch and parse user data, and update account balances. User interactions are managed via a simple command-line menu, prompting for inputs to perform the various banking operations. Error handling is implemented to catch and display response status codes and messages from the server.
